# Texture Packer

Texture Packer is designed to take the poorly packed images generated by [Shoebox](https://renderhjs.net/shoebox/) and repacks them into a more compact texture atlas.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Texture Packer can be run with a GUI:
```shell
python packerGUI.py
```
Alternatively, the Packer class can be imported and used within your own script.
```python
from packer import Packer
pkr = Packer()
images_paths = ["foor.png","bar.png"]
output_image = pkr.process_textures(image_paths) # returns PIL Image
output_image.save("atlas.png")
```
It's set up in a way that you can implement your own packing strategy.
```python
from packer import Packer, Packing_Strategy

class MyStrategy(Packing_Strategy):
    def Pack(self, box_dimensions, bounds):
        strip_width, strip_height = bounds
        new_coordinates = []
        for box_width, box_height in box_dimesions:
            new_coordinates.append((0,0)) # everything packed at origin
        return new_coordinates

pkr = Packer(strategy=MyStrategy)
```

## Future Work
Some of the future work to be added:
 - Work on the GUI
 - Add optional padding between textures
 - Improve packing algorithm (allow packing in deadspace below textures within a level)
